Sansho‡§ß‡§®‡§Æ‡•ç: The Intelligent R&D Proposal Platformüåü Key Features & Unique Selling Propositions (USPs)<details><summary>Click to expand Key Features</summary>Intelligent First-Pass Screening: A multi-agent AI system, led by a Triage Agent, performs a deep, context-based analysis of every proposal against the organization's standardized checklist4. This provides an objective score and detailed report, instantly filtering out non-compliant or low-quality submissions5.Unmatched Transparency & Auditability: Researchers get real-time status updates and actionable AI-generated feedback upon rejection6. The organization maintains a complete, immutable audit trail of every score and decision77777.AI-Powered Originality Check: Automatically compares new submissions against a secure vector database of all past projects8. It flags potential overlaps and provides a novelty score to human reviewers 9, using Cosine Similarity for semantic search10.Data-Driven Insights Hub: Aggregates anonymized submission data to reveal powerful trends11. This helps admins refine R&D strategy and empowers researchers to craft stronger, more compliant proposals121212121212121212.Robust Offline-First Experience: Features a powerful client-side drafting tool built with Dexie.js (IndexedDB)13131313. Researchers can work on complex proposals with no internet, and all work is saved securely and synced automatically upon reconnection14.</details>üöÄ Technical Stack<details><summary>Click to expand Technical Stack</summary>ComponentTechnologyDescriptionFrontendNext.js (React), Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui [cite: 124]Dynamic and responsive user interface[cite: 124].Backend/OrchestrationWorqhat.app Workflows [cite: 124]A serverless backend where each API endpoint is a secure, visual workflow that integrates logic, AI, and databases[cite: 124].AI/LLMGoogle Gemini 1.5 Flash (via Worqhat AI Actions) [cite: 124]Used for proposal scoring, analysis, and generating structured JSON outputs via Structured Chain Prompting[cite: 113, 114, 188].Semantic SearchWorqhat Vector Database & Google Text Embedding 004 [cite: 125]A managed vector store that holds proposal embeddings and powers the novelty check[cite: 125].Core DatabaseWorqhat.app WorqDB (PostgreSQL) [cite: 124]A fully managed, scalable SQL database used to store all core application data (Users, Proposals, Reviews)[cite: 124].AuthenticationWorqhat.app Auth (JWT) [cite: 124]Manages secure, token-based user sessions and enforces Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)[cite: 124, 256].</details>üß† AI Logic & Mitigation Strategy<details><summary>Click to expand AI Logic Details</summary>The AI integration is the core of the project, designed for accuracy and to mitigate risks like hallucination15:Embedding Generation: The new proposal's summary is embedded using the AI.EMBEDDINGS action16161616.Novelty Scoring: This embedding is used to query the past_projects_db Vector Store17. The workflow returns a similarity_score and the most similar project title18.Contextual Grading: This similarity_score is then injected into the main prompt for the AI.GENERATE_TEXT action (Gemini 1.5 Flash)19191919.Mitigation: Structured Chain Prompting is used20. Instead of open-ended questions, the AI is forced to follow a strict checklist prompt and output a verifiable JSON object21. This strategy forces the AI to make a series of smaller, verifiable decisions (e.g., Are the objectives SMART? true/false), guiding its reasoning and ensuring every critical criterion is evaluated accurately22.</details>‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started (Local Setup)<details><summary>Click to expand Setup Instructions</summary>Prerequisites: Node.js (v18+), Worqhat Account & API Key, PostgreSQL client (optional).Clone the Repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/KoynaKarmakar/pune-mit.git
